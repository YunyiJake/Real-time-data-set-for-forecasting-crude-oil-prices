# Real-time-data-set-for-forecasting-crude-oil-prices
The real time data set is used in Garratt, A., Vahey, S. P. &amp; Zhang, Y. (2018), `Forecasting the real price of oil: extending the analysis of baumeister and kilian (2015) to post-oil-price slump data', Unpublished manuscript .
We include the replication paper, data documentation and the data set in the file. NIESR has offered to hold the data, and hence this is a temporary file for researchers who want to work with or see the real-time data set before NISER publishing the data set.
